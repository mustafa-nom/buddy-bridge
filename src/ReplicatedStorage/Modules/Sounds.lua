-- Audio asset IDs for PHISH. Centralized so SfxController doesn't have to
-- carry magic asset IDs and so writers can swap a sound by editing one row.
--
-- We intentionally use only built-in `rbxasset://` paths that ship with
-- every Roblox client — no asset-ID lookups, no licensing, no "Asset type
-- does not match requested type" load failures. If a row has an empty
-- string, SfxController treats that event as silent (graceful no-op).
-- Drop in real `rbxassetid://...` ids when art passes them.
